## General Information
- We're detecting traffic in both the directions Up and Down directions. 
- It detects vehicle on the basis from camera and increase the counter. 
- Purpose of our project is to count vehicles with different body types and increase the value counter eachtime. 
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Technologies Used
- Algorithm - [Open_CV_CV2] (https://opencv.org/)
- Frontend & Cloud - [Streamlit] (https://streamlit.io/) 
- API - [Mapbox] (https://www.mapbox.com/)


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Traffic bifugation & counter
- Collects Data from Video
- Data plotting on taking time as a variable.


## Setup
To Run this project on your local machine Download Requirement.txt file. Append all the libraries; 
and to run the file use "streamlit run" command. 


## Usage
How does one go about using it?
Provide various use cases and code examples here.

## Project Status
Project is:  _complete_ . We are looking for logical improvements.


## Room for Improvement
Include the actual dataset on the model.

Room for improvement:
- Change the dataset to the Toronto's Actual Dataset 
- Improve the logocal functionality
